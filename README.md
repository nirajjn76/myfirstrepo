### Regarding react-diagram library for canvas ###

* We are using [react-diagram](https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams) library's [modified code](https://github.com/vivekshah-zymr/react-diagrams)
* For that we are generating tarball(.tbz) file, we have listed the points for how to generate tarball file under the readme file of [repo](https://github.com/vivekshah-zymr/react-diagrams)
* So in future when new versions get available we can fetch pull from the upstream and then generate again tarball files and have refrence over here to have the latest code of react-diagram library.
